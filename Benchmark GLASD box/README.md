## Empirical Convergence Study of GLASD over Hyper-rectangular Domain

This study evaluates empirical convergence behavior across **GLASD** and competing optimization methods for objective functions defined over a hyper-rectangular (box-constrained) parameter space.

1) Run `plot_ackley.m`, `plot_griewank.m`, `plot_rastrigin.m`, and `plot_rosenbrock.m`. These scripts generate convergence plots for the Ackley, Griewank, Rastrigin, and Rosenbrock benchmark functions, respectively. Each script automatically saves its output figures to the designated output directory.

2) Run `plot_combine_ALL.m`, which aggregates the plots produced in Step 1 and generates the final empirical convergence figure reported in the Supplementary Material of the manuscript.
