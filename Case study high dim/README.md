## Case Study: CRC Microbiome Correlation Analysis

This case study analyzes a colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiome dataset consisting of 220 CRC patients and \( p = 287 \) microbial taxa, with the goal of estimating and comparing correlation structures.

1) Run `Real_data/Microbiome_cluster_identifcation.R` to preprocess and filter the raw microbiome data into the format used for this case study.

2) Run `CRC_microbiome_analysis.m` to perform correlation estimation and downstream analysis using the processed dataset.

3) Run `Plot_heatmap.R` and `Plot_spectral_comparison.R` to generate the heatmap visualization and the spectral comparison plot reported in the manuscript.
