## Manopt Toolbox Requirement

For copyright reasons, the **Manopt** source files are not redistributed in this repository.  
Please download the Manopt MATLAB toolbox directly from the official website:

After downloading and extracting the toolbox, the `manopt` directory should have the following structure:

```text
manopt/
├── autodiff
├── core
├── lifts
├── manifolds
├── solvers
└── tools
```
After downloading, please replace the existing `manopt` folder in this repository (which contains only instructions and no source files) with the downloaded `manopt` folder.
