# GLASD: Global Adaptive Stochastic Descent for Robust Correlation Estimation

This repository provides an implementation of **GLASD (Global Adaptive Stochastic Descent)**, a loss-agnostic, black-box optimization framework for **robust estimation of high-dimensional correlation matrices** under general Mahalanobis-type loss functions. The methods and experiments in this repository correspond to the manuscript:

> **Robust Correlation Estimation under General Loss Functions**  
> Priyam Das, Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University

GLASD is designed to reliably optimize **non-convex, non-smooth, and even discontinuous objectives** over the space of positive definite correlation matrices, without requiring gradient information or smoothness assumptions.

## Key Features

- **Loss-agnostic framework**  
  Supports Gaussian, Huber, truncated quadratic, Tukey’s biweight, and other user-defined Mahalanobis losses.

- **Geometry-aware optimization**  
  Uses a bijective hyperspherical (angular) parameterization of the correlation matrix space to enforce constraints by construction.

- **Derivative-free global optimization**  
  Combines adaptive stochastic coordinate descent with controlled forced exploration, enabling reliable global search.

- **Theoretical guarantees**  
  Includes global convergence guarantees and statistical consistency results under mild regularity conditions.

- **Practical applicability**  
  Demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-data applications, including cancer proteomic and microbiome datasets.
